# Login Troubleshooting Guide

## Common Login Issues

### Issue 1: "Invalid username or password"

**Problem**: You're using the wrong field to login.

**Solution**: 
- ✅ Use your **username** (the one you entered during registration)
- ❌ Don't use your email address
- ❌ Don't use your full name

**Example**:
- If you registered with username: `john123`
- Login with: `john123` (not your email or "John Doe")

### Issue 2: "Account not approved"

**Problem**: Your account status is PENDING and needs admin approval.

**Solution**:
1. After registration, your account status is **PENDING**
2. An admin must approve your account before you can login
3. Login as admin (`admin` / `admin123`) and go to Admin Dashboard
4. Click "Approve" next to your pending account
5. Then you can login with your username and password

### Issue 3: Can't remember your username

**Solution**:
- After successful registration, the login page will show your username
- Check your registration confirmation message
- Contact admin if you forgot your username

## Step-by-Step Login Process

### For New Users:
1. **Register** → Fill registration form with a unique username
2. **Wait for Approval** → Admin must approve your account
3. **Login** → Use your **username** (not email) and password

### For Admin:
- Username: `admin`
- Password: `admin123`
